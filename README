# Brookie

Brookie is a small and simple Django application which makes it easy for you to
create *invoices* and *quotes* for your customers in PDF. This all through the Django admin interface.

It was created in a 2-day sprint by Bread and Pepper for it's own use. We decided
to release it to the community so other small companies can manage their invoices and quotes.
